    <p> Welcome! </p>
    <p> My name is David and I am building my first website! </p>
    <p> Well actually, not really. </p>
    <p> You see I tried to learn "programming" over summer in high school by going on FreeCodeCamp and learning 
        the stuff they had on there (which was all front-end stuff), but I found it extremely boring and 
        uninteresting. </p>
    <p> However, here I am taking a stuco on it! </p>
    <p> I'm pretty busy this semester, but hopefully I'll be able to build something really cool out of this
        once I get my stuff straight in homework and other classes/stuff. </p>
    <p> I'm a college student studying engineering btw, in case you were wondering. </p>
    <p> What's your name? </p>
    <input type="text">
    <input type="submit">
    <p> That button doesn't do anything (yet). Sorry! </p>
    <p> I plan for this website to be my little corner of the Internet once I finish building it (and as such 
        plan on making it very homely). For now, please enjoy some random pictures! </p>
